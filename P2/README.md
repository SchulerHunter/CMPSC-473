Submission Guidelines
=====================

- Ensure your Git local environment is configured and setup, and you have signed up for GitHub. (Refer to P0 for detailed steps on this). You should have a valid GitHub account (personal accounts are fine).
- Accept the invitation for P2 from the link provided in write up. This should setup your private repository for this project with the starter code on GitHub. Please note, this is by default a private repository only accessible by you and the course instructors. You can add your team-mates as collaborators (follow P0 for this). Please ensure this is the ONLY repository that you submit your code to. Any of your code should NOT BE published publically on your own repositories. Contact the TAs incase you have queries regarding this.
- Clone your remote (private) repository using the $ git clone command to get started on the project. (Refer to P0 for the detailed explanation).
- Ensure you commit your code often and on time using the $ git commit and the $ git push commands (similar to how you had done P0).
- The last commit that you do prior to the timeline will be taken as your final submission
- The projects (including a brief report) is due by 11:59PM on the designated day and the reports+programs. Ensure you push all these into the git repos by then.
- NO EXTENSIONS WILL BE ENTERTAINED. You will not be able to submit after the deadline, as the Git repos will not allow you to push code.
- ENSURE YOU PUSH YOUR CODE TO THE GIT REPOS BEFORE THE DEADLINE.
- You need to set up an appointment with your TAs to demonstrate your implementation.
